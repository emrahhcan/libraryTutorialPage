    then a letter. Always read each digit separately in the Cutter Line. Remember if there is a decimal point, take one space at a time.

    Always read each character or digit separately in the Cutter Line.\n Remember - if there is a decimal point, 
    take each individual character one at a time. This line is read as "H, two, seven, seven."\n

const wrongResult2Eng = `Sorry - Remember 'Letters before numbers'. Try again.`;
const wrongResult3Eng = `Try again! Look closely at the entire call number.`;

const wrongResult6Eng = `Wrong! Make sure you treat the second line as a whole number (467 is less than 674).`;

const wrongResult8Eng = `Wrong! Remember, the second line is treated as a whole number - 143 is less than 1421.`;
